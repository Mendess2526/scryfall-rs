/// Scryfall provides daily exports of our card data in bulk files. Each of
/// these files is represented as a bulk_data object via the API. URLs for files
/// change their timestamp each day, and can be fetched programmatically.
///
/// ## Please note:
///
/// * Card objects in bulk data include price information, but prices should be
///   considered dangerously stale after 24 hours. Only use bulk price
///   information to track trends or provide a general estimate of card value.
///   Prices are not updated frequently enough to power a storefront or sales
///   system. You consume price information at your own risk.
/// * Updates to gameplay data (such as card names, Oracle text, mana costs,
///   etc) are much less frequent. If you only need gameplay information,
///   downloading card data once per week or right after set releases would most
///   likely be sufficient.
/// * Every card type in every product is included, including planar cards,
///   schemes, Vanguard cards, tokens, emblems, and funny cards. Make sure
///   you‚Äôve reviewed documentation for the Card type.
///
///
/// Bulk data is only collected once every 12 hours. You can use the card API
/// methods to retrieve fresh objects instead.
