//! Scryfall provides daily exports of their card data in bulk files. Each of
//! these files is represented as a bulk_data object via the API. URLs for files
//! change their timestamp each day, and can be fetched programmatically.
//!
//! # Warning
//!
//! These bulk dumps are not paginated, this means that they will be potentially
//! stored in memory in its entirety while being iterated over.
//!
